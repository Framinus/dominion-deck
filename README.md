This is a custom deck randomizer program for the game Dominion. While there are other great deck builder sites for this game, I wanted one that could include parameters that my friends and I use when building our own games, such as the inclusion of "Power Cards" (like "Pirate Ship", "Treasure Map", and "Goons") and of cost equity. I will build the basic deck building interface and then develop ways to sort for these categories. Enjoy!

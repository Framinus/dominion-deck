### Dominion Deck

This is a custom deck randomizer program for the game Dominion. While there are other great deck builder sites for this game, I wanted one that could include parameters that my family and I use when building our own games, such as the inclusion of "Power Cards" (like "Pirate Ship", "Treasure Map", and "Goons") and of cost equity. I will build the basic deck building interface and then develop ways to sort for these categories. 

## Developed features: 

- Built database to store cards, saved sets, and users.

## Core features to develop: 

- Authentication for users
- Pug templates for all pages:
  - Signup/login
  - Main page
  - Search History
- Algorithm for selecting ten random cards from the possible options.

## Bonus features:

- Allowing user to delete one card from the produced set and get another random card that fits the parameters they have already entered.
- A way to rate the sets that come up in search history.
